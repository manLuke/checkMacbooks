# Hey Siri, find a macbook according to my parameters on [Bazos.cz](https://www.bazos.cz/)
### This program finds the product for you according to your parameters, saves it to a file `json/sawProducts.json` and sends it to an email.

# You need to do 2 things to set it up
- Add parameter to `json/items.json`
- setup email client in `modules/sendEmail.ts` and eventually add html template for your email message
